# refx Documentation

**refx** is a modern header-only C++ library designed for mobile robotics and navigation. Its core philosophy is to leverage the C++ type system to provide compile-time safety for all geometric and geodetic calculations. This prevents a wide class of common and difficult-to-debug errors that arise from incorrect handling of coordinate reference frames.

This is the **Library Documentation Repository**. The code can be found [here](https://github.com/mosaico-labs/refx).
